# Slimy
[Live Demo](https://edmondthui.github.io/slimy/)  
Slimy is a homage to one of my favourite flash games called Fishy. Now that browsers no longer support flash, the next generation will not understand what flash games are. These games were a large part of my childhood which is what inspired me to make this game. Grow your slime by eating enemies and destroy the ecosystem!

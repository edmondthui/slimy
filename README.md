# Slimy
[Live Demo](https://edmondthui.github.io/slimy/)  
Slimy is a homage to one of my favourite flash games called Fishy. Now that browsers no longer support flash, the next generation will not understand what flash games are. These games were a large part of my childhood which is what inspired me to make this game. Grow your slime by eating enemies and destroy the ecosystem!

In this game, you are a slime that grows whenever you touch a smaller enemy. Use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Once you eat 100 enemies you win!

## Technologies Used
